        and other chemicals that can make you sick. Skip it altogether. Please,\n please just never eat fried chicken.</string>
    <string name="Cheeseburger">Where do I begin? Fat, calories, and cholesterol \n
        are only part of the problem with bacon cheeseburgers, \n
        which also contain HFCS (in the buns and condiments), dairy, salt, hormones,\n
        and antibiotics. Itâ€™s just plain nasty. Instead, \n
        opt for a veggie burger or an avocado sandwich.</string>

        produced in comparable ways.</string>
    <string name="Butter">Butter is linked with long term weight gain.Intake of butter should be in moderation,\n
        as regular consumption of butter is bad for your heart.Most frequently made from cows\' milk,\n

    <string name="juice">Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or seafood, such as clam juice.\n

Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled its preservation without using fermentation (which is used in wine production).\n
        The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day).\n
        Fruit juice consumption on average increases with country income level.</string>
